# React Learning Roadmap 2025

## Introduction
This roadmap provides a structured path to mastering React in 2025, taking into account the latest ecosystem developments and best practices. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to update your React skills, this guide will help you navigate the learning process efficiently.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into React, ensure you have a solid foundation in:
- HTML & CSS
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
  - Arrow functions
  - Destructuring
  - Modules
  - Promises/async-await
  - Array methods (map, filter, reduce)

## Phase 1: React Fundamentals

### Core Concepts

  - Create React App (for beginners)
  - Vite (recommended for new projects)
  - React DevTools

- **JSX Basics**
  - Syntax and expressions
  - Conditional rendering
  - Lists and keys

- **Components**
  - Functional components (primary approach)
  - Component composition
  - Props and children

- **Hooks**
  - useState for state management
  - useEffect for side effects
  - useRef for DOM references
  - Custom hooks

- **Forms & Events**
  - Controlled components
  - Form validation
  - Event handling

## Phase 2: Advanced React Patterns

- **Performance Optimization**
  - React.memo
  - useMemo and useCallback
  - Code splitting and lazy loading

- **Context API**
  - Creating context
  - useContext hook
  - Context organization patterns

- **Advanced Hooks**
  - useReducer for complex state
  - useLayoutEffect
  - useImperativeHandle
  - useId (for accessibility)

- **Component Patterns**
  - Compound components
  - Render props (less common in 2025)
  - Higher-order components (legacy but good to know)

## Phase 3: Modern React Ecosystem

- **State Management**
  - React's built-in state management

- **Routing**
  - React Router v7
  - Routing patterns and best practices
  - Dynamic routing

- **Data Fetching**
  - React Query/TanStack Query
  - SWR
  - RTK Query (if using Redux)

- **Styling Solutions**
  - CSS Modules
  - Styled Components
  - Tailwind CSS integration
  - CSS-in-JS performance considerations

- **Form Management**
  - React Hook Form
  - Formik (less popular but still used)
  - Zod for validation

## Phase 4: Modern React Architecture

- **Server Components (React 19+)**
  - Understanding client vs server components
  - Streaming and Suspense
  - Data fetching with server components

- **React Concurrent Features**
  - Transitions
  - Suspense for data fetching
  - Deferred values

- **Next.js Integration**
  - App Router
  - Server components implementation
  - API routes and server actions

- **Testing**
  - Vitest (fast test runner)
  - React Testing Library
  - Cypress for E2E testing
  - Component testing strategies

## Phase 5: Advanced Topics

- **TypeScript with React**
  - Component typing
  - Hooks with TypeScript
  - Advanced patterns and generics

- **Animation**
  - Framer Motion
  - React Spring
  - CSS transitions

- **Internationalization**
  - i18next
  - Format.js

- **Accessibility (a11y)**
  - ARIA attributes
  - Focus management
  - Accessible components

- **Performance Profiling**
  - React Profiler
  - Web Vitals monitoring
  - Lighthouse optimization

## Phase 6: Building Production Applications

- **Project Structure**
  - Feature-based organization
  - Scaling React applications
  - Monorepos with Turborepo

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Auth patterns
  - JWT implementation
  - OAuth integration

- **Deployment Options**
  - Vercel
  - Netlify
  - AWS Amplify
  - Docker containers

- **CI/CD for React Apps**
  - GitHub Actions
  - Automated testing
  - Deployment workflows
